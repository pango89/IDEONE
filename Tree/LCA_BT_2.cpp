METHOD 2 (USING SINGLE TRAVERSAL)
-----------------------------------------
IF WE ASSUME THAT THE KEYS N1 AND N2 ARE PRESENT IN BINARY TREE, WE CAN FIND LCA USING 
SINGLE TRAVERSAL OF BINARY TREE AND WITHOUT EXTRA STORAGE FOR PATH ARRAYS.
THE IDEA IS TO TRAVERSE THE TREE STARTING FROM ROOT. IF ANY OF THE GIVEN KEYS (N1 AND N2) 
MATCHES WITH ROOT, THEN ROOT IS LCA (ASSUMING THAT BOTH KEYS ARE PRESENT). 
IF ROOT DOESNâ€™T MATCH WITH ANY OF THE KEYS, WE RECUR FOR LEFT AND RIGHT SUBTREE. 
THE NODE WHICH HAS ONE KEY PRESENT IN ITS LEFT SUBTREE AND THE OTHER KEY PRESENT IN 
RIGHT SUBTREE IS THE LCA. IF BOTH KEYS LIE IN LEFT SUBTREE, THEN LEFT SUBTREE HAS 
LCA ALSO, OTHERWISE LCA LIES IN RIGHT SUBTREE.

TIME COMPLEXITY: TIME COMPLEXITY OF THE SOLUTION IS O(N) AS THE 
METHOD DOES A SIMPLE TREE TRAVERSAL IN BOTTOM UP FASHION.
NOTE THAT THE  METHOD ASSUMES THAT KEYS ARE PRESENT IN BINARY TREE. 
IF ONE KEY IS PRESENT AND OTHER IS ABSENT, THEN IT RETURNS THE PRESENT KEY AS LCA 
(IDEALLY SHOULD HAVE RETURNED NULL).
